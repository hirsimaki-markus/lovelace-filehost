# What?
This project is my submission for the final task of Programmable Web Project
course at University of Oulu. If you are unfamiliar with the course, consider
this repository as an example implementation for simplistic flask-to-redis
file storage API. Otherwise, read on.





# What to do first after cloning the repo?
Step I
* Make note that everything has been tested (only) in WSL.

Step II: install prequisites for python
* `/pwp$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Step III: install redis
* `/pwp$ curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg`
* `/pwp$ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list`
* `/pwp$ sudo apt-get update`
* `/pwp$ sudo apt-get install redis`

Step IV: run the project
* `/pwp$ sudo redis-server current_redis.conf # start redis backend`
* `/pwp$ python run.py # run the app itself`
* `/pwp$ sensible-browser http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/files # smoke test`

Step V: run the tests
* `/pwp$ python -m pytest -vv -s # Service must be running in background.`

Step VI: read the docs
* `/pwp$ cat readme.md # this file`
* `/pwp$ sensible-browser http://127.0.0.1:8080/ # more docs`





# How to housekeep when making changes?
Just let black format everything related to python:
* `/pwp$ black . --line-length 79`

Force free zombie ports in case of emergency:
* `/pwp$ lsof -nti:8080 | xargs kill -9`

Useful redis commands:
* `/pwp$ sudo redis-server current_redis.conf # with conf`
* `/pwp$ sudo service redis-server start # without conf`
* `/pwp$ sudo service redis-server stop # halt`

Creating more database bindings in redis:
* `/pwp$ code app/models.py`




# How to read snowflake IDs used as file identifiers?
Example: `ccfa29b9a0972f37-1745eec0568a8261-d925c3bee74746...99bef7cdeb98bab1`
* Part 1: `ccfa29b9a0972f37`
  * Is hashed server hostname identifier.
  * Sortable, but hides original names.
* Part 2: `1745eec0568a8261`
  * Is unix timestamp in nanoseconds.
  * Sortable chronologically.
  * datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(0x1745eec0568a8261/10**9)
* Part 3: `d925c3bee74746b3b6f353253f004b7b2a6db94ce4114a1299bef7cdeb98bab1`
  * Impossible to guess random ID.
    * Like, assume quadrillion guessing attempts per second, from the big bang
      to this moment, and we have exhausted less than one octillionth of one
      nonillionth of the search space.
  * Not sortable.



# Todo?
In python:
* Replace stub functions in `permissions.py` with actual implementation
  when details exist for authprovider
* Add new tests when authprovider is well defined.

Architechture-wise:
* helpers.get_client() currently assumes localhost.
* helpers.get_server_address() currently assumes localhost.
* Test suites currently assume localhost.
* Deploy a WSGI like gunicorn to get flask to scale.
* Optionally deploy reverse proxy like nginx to allow for gunicorn to safely
  serve priviledged ports such as the http/https defaults 80 and 443.
  * It is not safe to run wsgi as root to serve priviledged ports.
  * It is not safe to serve on ip 0.0.0.0 with reverse proxy.
